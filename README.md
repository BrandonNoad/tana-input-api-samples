# üë®‚Äçüíª How to use

This project has a basic client for Tanas Add2Node-API and a few example scripts.

The client uses node-fetch, but native fetch can be used from Node 17.5 with `--experimental-fetch`

Please note that the API currently has the following restrictions:

- One call per second per token
- Max 100 nodes created per call
- Max 5000 chars in one request

Please get in touch if you are hitting these limits

## Example:Books

This example shows how we can create new fields, and then a new tag using those fields. We then create a few books using the tag, and add some extra content to the books afterwards.

`TANA_TOKEN=token TANA_FILE_ID=fileId yarn run example:books`
